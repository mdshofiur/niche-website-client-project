some features:-

* If a user is logged in, he/she will see another option on the header is called Dashboard and inside that dashboard a normal user (not an admin) will see options like pay,My Orders, Review, Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. The pay page will say: Payment system coming soon.

* If an admin logs in, he/she will not see the options that a normal user sees. Insted an admin will see Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. Details about Manage all orders or Manage products will be provided later.

* On the Review page, users should be able to add a review and that review will appear on the home age. Right now you will see every review on the home page. There is no limit on the numbers of reviews or the order of the review.

* Implement email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name and once a user is logged in, the user name, and the logout button should appear on the header which will log out the user once clicked. 

* At the time of adding review, you may add an input field to add ratings (a number between 0-5). Based on the rating, display rating star on each reviews in the home page
